All,
 
During this meeting we will finalize the short list questions and agenda for both DR and RFP vendors invited to the shortlist.
 
Participation in this meeting is not required by the procurement rules, but it is strongly encouraged as it is the last chance for any team member to include questions or concerns before the list is sent out to the vendors.
 
If you cannot be in person but still want to participate:
 
Call-In Number: +1 (877) 603-8688
