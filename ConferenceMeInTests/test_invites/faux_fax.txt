Subject:               January 2012 Shared Service Strategy Session

 

As you know, post-Pangaea, we are planning to create a Shared Services Organization (SSO) for Newmont to be launched in the fourth quarter of 2012. We are inviting a select group of participants for a Strategy Session in early 2012 to help shape the organization and the rollout of shared services.  Your attendance is critical because your input and leadership will lay the foundation for a successful implementation.

Dates: Monday, 30 January to Wednesday, 1 February (3 days)

Location: Denver, Doubletree Hotel, 7801 East Orchard Road, Greenwood Village, CO 80111

Your insight will help determine:

·         Scope of SSO:  Functions and Processes

·         Vision/Mission

·         Service Management Framework

·         Assumptions and Risks

·         Roadmap for SSO Development and Rollout:  Timing and Sequencing

                       

We recognize this requires a significant time commitment on your behalf.   To ensure it is productive, Ernst & Young will be reaching out to schedule a 45 minute interview with each of you in advance of the session. We anticipate the interviews will begin the last week of November through early January.  Your candid input will help set the stage for an effective session.

A week before the session, we will send you a detailed agenda and some pre-read materials. We ask that you review both prior to attending.

Please maintain confidentiality around the session and the SSO as we address critical questions.

We look forward to your participation.  We expect a highly interactive session so please come prepared to engage in spirited discussion and thoughtful deliberation.

Thank you,

Kelly and Gerry
